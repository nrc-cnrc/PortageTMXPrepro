Directory */preparation/ contains a Makefile to extract text from TMX files and
clean it up.  The Makefile.params file is use to setup various parameters
indicating what the TMX file(s) is(are) called, which ones should be used to
sample dev and test sets from, which ones should be combined, etc.

Directory */corpora/ is where the dev and test sampling happens.  It reuses the
same Makefile.params from */preparation/.
