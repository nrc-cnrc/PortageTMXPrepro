                                 tmx-prepro

The tmx-prepro module is intended to automate extracting sentence pairs from
TMX files and splitting them into the train/dev/test files needed to train
PortageII.

Directory template/tmx/ is where you drop your input TMX files.

Directory template/preparation/ contains a Makefile to extract text from TMX
files and clean it up.  The Makefile.params file is use to setup various
parameters indicating what the TMX file(s) is(are) called, which ones should be
used to sample dev and test sets from, which ones should be combined, etc.

Directory template/corpora/ is where the dev and test sampling happens.  It
reuses the same Makefile.params from template/preparation/.

                               Getting Started

1. Make a copy of the template directory to use for the corpus.
      cd $PORTAGE/tmx-prepro
      cp -pr template /path/to/training/area/template

2. Drop your TMX files (with .tmx extension) into the tmx sub-directory:
   /path/to/training/area/template/tmx.

3. Edit the Makefile.params in the preparation subdirectory as needed:
   /path/to/training/area/template/preparation/Makefile.params
   If you plan to combine all the TMX files in the tmx directory from step 2
   into a single training corpus, then Makefile.params may be used as is.
   If you want to have multiple domain corpora or you want a single corpus with
   a specific name prefix, you will need to edit the Makefile.params to define
   your domain names, and the makeup of the dev/test sets.

3. Extract text from the TMX files and clean it up:
      cd /path/to/training/area/template/preparation
      make all

4. Sample to create dev, test and training corpus files.
      cd /path/to/training/area/template/corpora
      make all

5. Copy the train, dev, and test raw files to your framework/corpora directory:
      cd /path/to/training/area/template/corpora
      cp all.* train.* test*.* dev*.* /path/to/training/area/framework/corpora

Additional information about processing TMX files can be found in the TMX
Processing page of the user manual on your PortageII distro
(doc/user-manual.html).

Running "tmx2lfl.pl -h" will give details on tmx2lfl.pl, the tool used by
tmx-prepro to extract text out of your TMX files.
